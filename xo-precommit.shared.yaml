# XO-Core Pre-Commit Essentials

This directory contains shared pre-commit hook configurations for use in XO projects.

## Usage

To include these hooks in your project:

1. Add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   - include: infra/hooks/xo-core-precommit.yaml
   ```

2. Install the hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Contents

- `xo-core-precommit.yaml`: Shared local hooks like `pytest-check`, `coverage-badge`, submodule cleanup, and safety guards.

These are designed to help avoid common pitfalls and enforce consistent developer experience across XO repositories.
