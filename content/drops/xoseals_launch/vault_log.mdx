ðŸ”‘ **ENS Identity Move â€“ July 4, 2025**

The `21xo.eth` legacy address transferred ownership control to a fresh cold wallet:
`0xeBaB...e42`. This move was deliberate â€” a clean slate with roots in long-term vision.

ðŸ’¡ This cold wallet will anchor the **xoseals.eth** identity and be used for XO-native minting,
ownership proofs, and seal authorization.

âœ… Transition complete. History acknowledged, future aligned.
