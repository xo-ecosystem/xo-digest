# ✅ July Recovery Milestone

This milestone documents the recovery steps and environment repair actions following the broken state of `xo-fab`, caused by circular imports in the Vault module and improper loader handling.

## 🔧 Goals

- Stabilize the Fabric task loader
- Refactor `vault_tasks.py` and its dependencies
- Delegate split cleanups to Codex and Cursor
- Restore working `xo-fab loader.list`
- Track health checks via Agent dispatches

## 🔁 Actions Taken

- [x] Moved `from . import unseal, bootstrap` inside `vault/__init__.py` functions
- [x] Created `fix_loader.py` for dynamic and safe loading
- [x] Aliased `xo-fab` to clean `fabfile.py` in dev path
- [ ] Verified `xo-fab loader.list` with full task registry
- [ ] Added Agent preview and logs for `agent.dispatch:dev_checker`

## 💬 Next

> Delegate `vault_tasks.py` refactor + loader discovery fallback to Codex + Cursor
