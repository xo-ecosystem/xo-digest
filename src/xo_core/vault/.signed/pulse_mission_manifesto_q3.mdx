## üöÄ XO Mission Manifesto ‚Äì Q3 Highlights

1. **Vault Autopilot & Seals Activation**
   Finalize all automation for Vault signing, syncing, and explorer deployment. Empower every seal to live and breathe on-chain, with tracked provenance and auto-webhook alerts.

2. **Pulse Orbit Expansion**
   Launch `/pulse.archive`, enable user-friendly publishing from templates (`pulse.new`), and introduce `pulse.react` for community engagement with real-time emoji responses and comment threading.

3. **Eighth Seal Experience**
   Introduce `/drops/eighth_seal` as a dynamic page combining scroll lore, variant selector, mint access, and Agent0 conversations. Refine UX and storytelling to unlock wider participation.

4. **Codex & Contributor Mode**
   Enable live Codex prompts from within the XO dev environment, connected to vault-synced `.xo-seed.yml` logic. Introduce `xo-fab codex.reply` and `/agent0/trigger` for suggestion loops.

5. **Pulse x Vault Convergence**
   Sync every `.mdx` pulse with its `.coin.yml` metadata and log to `/vault/logbook/`. Support full verifiability, comment threading, and `xo-fab pulse.sign_all`.

6. **Collective Onboarding Kit**
   Finalize the `xo-dev-scaffold` + `pulse.dev_scaffold.yml` publishing pipeline. Allow one-click repo spins, IPFS pinning, and Vault-based contribution flows.

7. **Outreach & Constellation Mapping**
   Launch `/constellation` as the visual story map and invitation portal. Every artifact, message-in-a-bottle, or reaction earns a place in the living cosmos.

ü™ê _Q3 is about linking what lives (vault, pulse, seed, coin) into an interactive narrative that builds momentum, trust, and visibility. The constellation lights up together._
