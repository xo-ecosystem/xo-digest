🌬️ **Aether** — once the breath of the cosmos, now the breath of XO.

In the ancient world, *aether* was the invisible fifth element — the force that carried light and fire through the celestial realm. At XO, **Aether** is our poetic framing for the energy that fuels interactions: a conceptual gas unit that honors clarity, fairness, and contribution without inflating complexity.

## Why Aether?

Aether introduces a fluid model of interaction across XO:
- 🪙 **Gas unit for network activity** (read, mint, pulse, archive)
- 💫 **Symbolic layer for collective contribution**
- 🔁 **Bridge for fee abstraction**, even when Ether or native tokens are unavailable

## Use Cases

- Pulse mints and publishing
- Signature archival actions
- Unlockable rewards or token streams
- Cross-domain routing via `xo.to`, `xo.games`, `xodrops.com`

## Hybrid Fee Handling

Aether can wrap existing token systems (like ETH, MATIC, AR) until regulatory clarity lands. Users pay with available native tokens, but internally denominated in Aether for clarity and standardization.
