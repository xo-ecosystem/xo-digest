😹 **Welcome to LOLCATS** — the coin nobody asked for, but everybody meowed for.

> **Phase 1**: Post memes. Earn $LOLCAT. We don’t care what chain. Just vibes and volume.

---

📜 **Phase 2 - Meowifesto Reveal**
- Hidden pulses await.
- When enough $LOLCAT changes paws, `/vault/memetic_path` opens.
- 🧠 Smart memes win scrolls. Dumb memes… still win $LOLCAT.

---

🌌 **Phase 3 - Cats in the Constellation**
- Use LOLCATS to mint narrative infiltrators.
- Some will turn into lore nodes inside the `/constellation`
- Others may become worthy of pulse sealing.

🚀 This isn’t a rug. It’s a scratching post for the mind.
