## 🚀 Reveal (Public-Facing Order)

| 💡 Step               | What                                           | Why                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Drop 1: `eighth_seal`| Pulse page + gear + QR + Digest                | First collector drop, “XO begins…”   |
| Digest Live          | Auto-published to /vault/daily + Telegram      | Shows heartbeat of XO                |
| Dev Scaffolding Open | Codex connected, invite 1–2 testers            | Attract aligned builders quietly     |
| `/constellation` Lore Map | Visual & narrative entry point          | Open worldbuilding + join flow       |
| XO.org landing       | Wait until Drop + Digest are visible           | Avoid “empty shell” look             |

## 💤 Pause/Defer

| 💤 Pause               | Reason                                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Thirdweb mint full setup | Simulate mint via mock drop for now             |
| IP-heavy public Pulse   | Avoid leaking broad ecosystem before drop         |
| Heavy Discord setup     | Telegram + on-chain chat enough for now           |
| Vault Explorer public   | Release after 3+ digest entries                   |
| Domain renewals         | Review after July 15, prioritize `xo.games`       |

## 💬 Notes on Investor Attraction

- Use **lolcat teaser coin** or side drops as interest beacons.
- **Do not hand over steering** — use narrative, gear & pulse to onboard aligned supporters.
- Delay deep investor splits until foundation is rock-solid.
